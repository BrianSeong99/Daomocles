# Why we need Daomocles
As we know, DAOs are designed to be transparent and democratic, but in practice, they can be opaque and exclusive. Without proper tools for financial transparency and accountability, DAOs can become susceptible to corruption and mismanagement. DAOmocles was created to address this problem and provide a solution that promotes transparency and accountability within DAOs.

According to our research&interviews, different roles in the DAO community have expressed the need for financial transparency in DAOs. With DAOmocles:

First, for DAO members, we can easily access and understand the financial status of the organization, including the source, flow, and use of each fund. we can also give feedback on the financial flow by questioning or liking. This promotes trust and collaboration within the DAO community, which is essential for the long-term success of any decentralized organization.

Second, for DAO management, we can efficiently manage the treasury and financial affairs. By providing a comprehensive view of the organization's finances, DAO builders can make informed decisions and ensure that resources are being used in the most effective and efficient way possible.

Overall, DAOmocles is an essential tool for any DAO that wants to promote transparency and accountability, build trust and collaboration within the community, and ensure the long-term success of the organization.

# Inspiration for DAOmocles
DAOmocles is a tool that helps members of a DAO check the financial information and monitor the performance of the organization. The name DAOmocles is inspired by the story of the Sword of Damocles, which is a powerful metaphor for the risks and uncertainties that come with financial power and responsibility.

In the story, Damocles is a courtier who is granted the opportunity to sit on the throne of the king. However, above the throne hangs a sword suspended by a single hair, symbolizing the constant danger and threat that comes with great power. Similarly, a DAO has the responsibility to manage and allocate funds in a responsible and transparent way, and DAOmocles provides members with the tools they need to ensure that the organization remains financially stable and accountable.

The name DAOmocles emphasizes the importance of financial oversight and transparency in the management of a DAO. With this tool, members can stay vigilant and monitor the financial health of the organization, just as Damocles had to stay alert to the threat of the sword above his head. Ultimately, the goal of DAOmocles is to empower members with the knowledge and tools they need to manage financial risks and ensure the long-term success of the DAO.

# Roadmap
In the next period of time, we will continue to iterate our products, this is our roadmap.
